- take into account human reaction time. get measurements of table. <- note that making the ball slower just makes it easier for players, and they can already play at the old (faster) speed.
- the ball cannot go faster than human reaction. should probably be somewhere around the limit <- if it goes near limit, the ball is probably getting smaller and is probably harder to watch.
- forces: drag, elasticity and deformity of the ball, magnus, etc.
- consider what the greatest angled shot may be (or spin shot).
- Consider HD resolution when filming a game?

The Problem:
	Assuming:
		Mass per area of the ball stays constant
		Paddle is a spring, ball does not deform significantly
	want to slow the game down as much as possible without compromsing play:
		most notably spin of the ball
	
	
	Two questions:
		overall rally time should be increased, so analyze in flight of the ball
		analyze ball on table part
